## Scope

This tool is designed for **consumer fireworks** (1-3 inch shells). Buffer distances: 50-1500m.

**CRITICAL DISCLAIMER FOR ARMENIA**: This document provides international safety standards as reference material. Armenian regulations for fireworks include:
- Time restrictions: 23:00-07:00 ban (except Dec 31, 23:00 to Jan 1, 01:00)
- Licensing: 3rd-5th class fireworks require professional licensing
- Sale restrictions: Licensed traders only
- **Distance buffers**: No specific distance requirements found in Armenian law as of December 2025

Users in Armenia MUST verify compliance with Armenian Ministry of Internal Affairs and State Fire Safety Authority before using these international reference distances.

**WARNING - PROFESSIONAL DISPLAYS**: This tool is NOT sufficient. Professional displays require NFPA 1123 compliance:
- NFPA 1123 formula: Distance (ft) = 70 × Shell diameter (inches)
- Example: 6-inch shell = 420 ft (128m) minimum
- Requires licensed pyrotechnician, permits, and professional safety assessment

## Buffer Categories

### CRITICAL HAZARDS

#### Fuel Stations (100m)
**Source**: NFPA 1123 (300 ft/91m from hazardous material storage) adapted for consumer fireworks; Missouri regulations (600 ft/183m from fuel stations)
**Confidence**: MEDIUM
**Note**: 100m is conservative adaptation from professional standards (NFPA 1123: 91m hazmat storage; Missouri: 183m fuel stations)

#### Airports (1500m)
**Source**: UK CAA CAP 736 (3 nautical miles/5.6 km notification zone, 10 nm extended control zone), ICAO aviation safety standards
**Confidence**: HIGH
**WARNING**: 1500m minimum exclusion zone for consumer fireworks (F2/F3) to prevent interference with approach/departure paths. Professional displays (F4) require notification within 5.6 km (3 nautical miles) and may require extended clearance up to 10 nm (18.5 km) for central runway zones. Aviation hazards include visual distraction (pilot blindness), debris ingestion by engines, and airspace conflicts (fireworks reach 400-1300 ft altitude).
**Note**: 5.6 km (3 nm) is standard notification distance per UK CAA CAP 736; 10 nm (18.5 km) is extended control zone for central runway approaches; 1500m is practical no-fire zone for glide path protection.

#### Helipads (500m)
**Source**: ICAO aviation safety best practices + helicopter operational characteristics
**Confidence**: MEDIUM
**Note**: Helicopter operations typically occur at 300-500 feet altitude, lower than commercial aircraft. 500m provides conservative buffer for civilian helipads (hospitals, corporate buildings). Military helipads may have stricter requirements - verify locally. Helipads on building rooftops still require buffer due to approach/departure corridors and rotor wash effects.

#### Power Plants (100m)
**Source**: US Municipal Codes for electrical infrastructure (150 ft rule adapted) + critical infrastructure protection
**Confidence**: MEDIUM
**Note**: 100m prevents fire risk to transformer oil and cooling systems, spark contact with electrical equipment, and provides security buffer for critical energy infrastructure. Modern equipment has surge protection, but fire risk from hot particles remains primary concern.

#### Electrical Substations (50m)
**Source**: US Municipal Codes (150 ft/45m from overhead electrical lines - Kittitas County WA, Massachusetts 527 CMR)
**Confidence**: MEDIUM
**Note**: 50m protects against potential smoke ionization effects on high-voltage equipment (theoretical concern) and spark contact with overhead lines. Primary risk is electrical arc flash from hot particles near high-voltage equipment.

#### Power Lines (30m)
**Source**: US Municipal Codes (150 ft/45m from overhead electrical lines - Kittitas County WA, Massachusetts 527 CMR) adapted for consumer fireworks
**Confidence**: MEDIUM
**Note**: 30m prevents spark contact with overhead electrical lines. US regulations require 150 ft (45m) for professional operations; 30m provides conservative safety margin for consumer fireworks (1-3 inch shells). Applies to overhead power lines (transmission and distribution). Underground cables do not require buffer.

#### Military Installations (100m)
**Source**: Security considerations and expert judgment
**Confidence**: LOW
**Note**: No public fireworks standards exist for military facilities (security-classified); 100m is minimum buffer. **WARNING for Armenia/conflict zones**: Consider 500m buffer to avoid hostile interpretation by base security, especially in current geopolitical context. **US Military**: Most US bases (Fort Detrick AE Reg 600-1, JBSA AFMAN 91-201) impose FULL BANS on civilian fireworks on base property, not just buffer zones.

### HEALTH & SAFETY

#### Hospitals (50m)
**Source**: Czech Pyrotechnic Articles Act 2025 (250m) adapted for consumer fireworks practicality
**Note**: Czech law mandates 250m from hospitals/nursing homes; 50m provides reasonable safety for consumer fireworks (1-3 inch shells)
**Confidence**: MEDIUM (derived from verified Czech regulation)

#### Schools (100m)
**Source**: International standards analysis (Missouri 600 ft/183m; Tasmania 500m verified) adapted for consumer fireworks
**Note**: Children are highly vulnerable population. 100m balances international standards (183-500m Tasmania/Missouri) with consumer fireworks practicality. **IMPORTANT: Czech Act 344/2025 does NOT legally protect schools** - only hospitals, nursing homes, zoos, and animal shelters have legal 250m protection in Czech law. School buffer is based on international best practices, not Czech regulation. Australian states have varying requirements (Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania each differ).
**Confidence**: MEDIUM (derived from verified international sources: Missouri RSMo 320.151, Tasmania WorkSafe, conservative adaptation)
#### Nursing Homes (50m)
**Source**: Czech Pyrotechnic Articles Act 2025 (250m) adapted for consumer fireworks practicality
**Note**: Czech law mandates 250m from nursing homes; 50m adapted for consumer use
**Confidence**: MEDIUM (derived from verified Czech regulation)

### ANIMAL WELFARE

#### Zoos (100m)
**Source**: Czech Pyrotechnic Articles Act 2025 (250m reduced to 100m for practicality)
**URL**: Act No. 344/2025 Coll., effective 1 December 2025
**Confidence**: MEDIUM
**Note**: Czech law requires 250m from zoos, animal shelters, hostels, nursing homes

#### Animal Shelters & Veterinary Clinics (30m)
**Source**: Czech Pyrotechnic Articles Act 2025 (250m) adapted for consumer fireworks practicality
**Note**: Czech Act 344/2025 mandates 250m from animal shelters (same as zoos). 30m is practical reduction for consumer fireworks at smaller veterinary clinics. Large animal facilities should use 100m buffer (zoo standard).
**Confidence**: MEDIUM (derived from verified Czech regulation, adapted for practicality)

---

### CULTURAL & RELIGIOUS

#### Churches & Religious Sites (50m)
**Source**: Missouri regulations (600 ft/183m from churches) adapted for consumer fireworks + cultural heritage protection
**Note**: Missouri requires 183m from churches for professional displays. 50m provides practical buffer for consumer fireworks. **Czech Act 344/2025 does NOT protect churches** - only hospitals, nursing homes, zoos, animal shelters are legally mandated in Czech law.
**Confidence**: MEDIUM (Missouri regulation verified, adapted for consumer use)
#### Memorials & Historic Sites (50m)
**Source**: CFPA-E Guideline No. 30:2013 (European fire protection for heritage buildings with combustible elements)
**Confidence**: MEDIUM
**Note**: Historic buildings often have timber roofs, hidden cavities, and surfaces vulnerable to smoke/soot damage

#### Museums & Galleries (30m)
**Source**: CFPA-E Guideline No. 30:2013 (heritage protection) + fire safety for cultural institutions
**Confidence**: MEDIUM
**Note**: Protects irreplaceable collections and building facades from smoke, soot, and spark damage

### INFRASTRUCTURE

#### Railways (50m)
**Source**: UK Network Rail safety recommendations + railway operational safety principles
**Confidence**: MEDIUM
**Note**: Railway detonators are SOUND-BASED warning devices (loud explosions), not visual signals. Primary risks from fireworks: radio communication interference, debris on tracks, unexpected noise causing operational confusion, and track worker safety. 50m is standard clearance zone for fire/smoke sources near railway corridors.

#### Roads (30m)
**Source**: UK Highways Act 1980 (50 ft/15m minimum from highways) + traffic safety best practices
**Confidence**: MEDIUM
**Note**: 30m for major highways prevents driver distraction and vehicle spark damage; UK law prohibits fireworks within 50 feet of highways (15m), making 30m buffer legally compliant and conservative. Consider local traffic density.

#### Buildings (30m)
**Source**: NFPA 1123 formula (70 ft per inch diameter) adapted for consumer fireworks
- **NFPA 1123 calculations** (70 ft/inch for aerial shells):
  - 1-inch aerial shell: 70 ft (21m) minimum
  - 2-inch aerial shell: 140 ft (43m) minimum
  - 3-inch aerial shell: 210 ft (64m) minimum
- **35 ft/inch formula** applies to mines/comets (not aerial shells)
- **Consumer fireworks practicality**: 30m buffer used for general buildings (below NFPA minimum)
- **Risk acceptance**: Users must verify no occupied structures within NFPA-compliant distance

**Confidence**: MEDIUM (NFPA standard verified, but buffer reduced for practicality)
**WARNING**: 30m is below NFPA 1123 minimum for 2-inch+ shells. Professional displays require strict NFPA compliance (128m+ for 6-inch shells).

#### Parking Lots (50m)
**Source**: NFPA 1124 fallout zone for 1.2-inch consumer shells
**Confidence**: MEDIUM
**Note**: 50m protects vehicles from hot particle damage to paint/glass and prevents car alarm activation; 20m insufficient for spark scatter from F3 category

## Additional Considerations for Implementation

### EU Fireworks Classification (Directive 2013/29/EU)

**Categories by hazard level:**
- **F1**: Very low hazard, negligible noise (sparklers, fountains) - For use in confined areas
- **F2**: Low hazard, low noise - Outdoor use, **minimum age varies by country (16-18 years)**, safe distance >5m (UK Gov 2025)
- **F3**: Medium hazard, not intended for confined areas - Outdoor use, minimum age 18 years, safe distance >25m (UK Gov 2025)
- **F4**: High hazard, for professional use only - Requires specialist knowledge

**Note on age requirements**: EU Directive 2013/29/EU sets framework, but member states determine specific ages. F2 category: UK/Ireland 18 years, some countries 16 years.

**Note**: UK Government October 2025 guidance confirms F2 category does not cause injury at distances >5m, F3 at distances >25m under normal conditions. Tool's 30-1500m buffers are highly conservative.

**Key labeling requirements** (can be used to filter dangerous zones):
- Minimum safety distances must be indicated on labels (F2, F3, F4)
- "For outdoor use only" marking (F2, F3, F4)
- Category clearly marked on product

**Practical application in code:**
- Tool could filter zones based on firework category
- F1: Smaller buffers acceptable in urban areas
- F2-F3: Standard consumer buffers (this tool's current scope)
- F4: Requires professional assessment, tool should display warning

### Weather Conditions (Not standardized but recommended)

**Wind considerations:**
- High winds increase debris scatter and fire risk
- Recommendation: Avoid use in winds >20 km/h (12 mph)
- **UK Government 2025**: "In windy conditions, increase this buffer significantly" (exact multiplier not specified)
- Professional guidance: 1.5-2× buffer multiplier in windy conditions (expert judgment)

**Rain/moisture:**
- Wet conditions reduce fire risk
- May affect performance and increase misfire risk

### Population Density

No standardized buffers found, but practical considerations:
- Dense urban areas: Prefer F1 category fireworks
- Suburban areas: F2-F3 acceptable with standard buffers
- Rural areas: More flexibility with larger buffers

**Implementation note:** Tool could adjust warnings based on building density within buffer zones
